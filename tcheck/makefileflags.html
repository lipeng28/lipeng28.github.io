		<h3>Makefile configuration</h3>
		
		<p>
			<li>To make T-Check work, add 
          <pre>
          	PFLAGS += -fnesc-mc-state
          </pre>      
     into the application Makefile. 
     <b>Note that</b> this flag is required
     </li>
   </p>
   
   <p>	
   	<li>
     If users want to specify high-level safety or liveness property, add 
      <pre>
          CFLAGS += -DSAFETY 
          CFLAGS += -DLIVENESS 
          CFLAGS += -D(SYMBOL)
      </pre>
      into the application Makefile. 
      <b>Note that</b> for SAFETY and LIVENESS flags, whether either one or both are 
      added depends on which kinds of properties to be checked. 
      (SYMBOL) denotes the [Application symbol] used as the argument of "preprocessing" perl script.
    </li>
   </p>
   
   <p>	
   	<li>
     If users want to activate the hardware part, add 
      <pre>
          CFLAGS += -DADCON  (ADC is on)      
          CFLAGS += -DUARTON  (UART is on)
          CFLAGS += -DSIM_CC2420 (Byte-level transmission is activated, 
          but do not recommend to use this option due to its impediment for high-level property checking) 
      </pre>
      into the application Makefile. 
    </li>
   </p>
   
    <p>	
   	<li>
     If users want to test applications, which do not contain any communication components, such as 
     NULL, Blink..., add 
      <pre>
         CFLAGS += -DSIM_ASSIST_COMM
      </pre>
      into the application Makefile. 
    </li>
   </p>
   
   <p>	
   	<li>
     If users want to test applications, which do not contain any timer components, such as 
     TestADC..., add 
      <pre>
         CFLAGS += -DSIM_ASSIST_TIMER
      </pre>
      into the application Makefile. 
    </li>
   </p>
   
   <p>
   	<li>
   	 If you want to test TestFtsp application, please add 
   	  <pre>
         CFLAGS += -DTIMESYNC
      </pre>
     into the application Makefile.
     <b>Note that</b> this is a special case.
