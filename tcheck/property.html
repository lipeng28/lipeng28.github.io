	<h3>1 User-specified properties wiring and writing</h3>
	<p>
		If a developer wishes to specify high-level properties, these take the form of nesC components providing 
		the <i>SimProperty</i> interface, which has two commands: <i>safetyPropertyCheck</i> and <i>livenessPropertyCheck</i>, 
		currently, T-Check can check multiple properties simultaneously. 
		And the auxiliary "preprocessing" perl script can be applied to automatically wire property 
		components into the application.
	</p>
	<h4> 1.1 How to use preprocessing scrip? </h4>
	Users may use the following instruction to automatically instrument some snippets of code.
	
  <p>./preprocessing [Application symbol] [A file containing the pairs of non-generic configuration and module]</p>
  <p>
  	<li>
  	[Application symbol] - Large-case symbol never used before in <i>SimPropertyCheckC.nc</i> component under the dir $TOSDIR/lib/tossim.
  	If used, then the script will halt the running and warn the users that they should pick a new symbol name.
    </li>
  	
  	<li>
    [A file containing pairs of configuration and module] - Each line in the file is composed of a pair 
  of <Non-generic configration dir> <Module dir>, <b>Note that</b> these two dirs must be expressed as a relative 
    dir which uses $TOSROOT as reference.
    </li>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Taking <i>MultihopOscilloscope</i> as example, users can use following command to automatically instrument code.
  </p>
  <p>
   ./preprocessing CTPPROPERTY <a href = "files/propertyWiring.txt">propertyWiring.txt<a>
  </p>
  
  <p>It is better to express the symbol name in a large case way, and the number of configuration and module pairs 
  in the propertyWiring.txt specifies the number of properties users want to provide</p>
  
  <p>At the beginning, the script asks users to choose one from three options</P>
  <p>
  	<li>
  		Edit. 
  		If users never use the script to instrument the property-related code before, they should
  		choose this option. 
  		Besides instrumenting necessary code into corresponding components, then script also implicitly backs up 
  		the modified components, i.e., suppose some code are automatically added into a component named "xxx.nc", then
  		the original component file will be copied into a newly created file named "xxx.nc.bak".
  	</li>
  	
  	<li>
  		Recover.
  		As the name suggests, users can employ this option to recover the modified components to their original
  		states.
  	</li>
  	
  	<li>
  		Delete.
  		If the users are satisfied with the instrumentation, then they can delete those backup files safely.
  	</li>
  </p>
  
  <p>After running this command</p>
  
  <p>
  	<li> 
  		(1) First, the following code will be instrumented into implementation part of <b>SimPropertyCheckC.nc</b> 
  	</li>
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    #ifdef CTPPROPERTY   
       components CtpP;
       SimPropertyCheckP.Property1 -> CtpP.Property1;
       SimPropertyCheckP.Property2 -> CtpP.Property2;
    #endif
  </pre>
  
  <p>
  	<li>
  		(2) Then, the SimPropertyCheckP.nc will be established upon the SimPropertyCheckP-Master.nc file and number of properties 
  		users want to specify. 
  	</li> 
  </p>
  
  <p> The following code will be added as uses parts, n denotes the number of property.</p>
  <pre>
    uses interface SimProperty as Property1;
  	 ...
  	uses interface SimProperty as Propertyn;
  </pre>
  
  <p> The relatively complex code will be added into implementation part of SimPropertyCheckP.nc, and we will not show the concrete code
  here </p>
  
  <p>
  	<li>
  		(3)	The following two snippets will be inserted into the <b>provides</b> part 
  		and <b>implementation</b> part of <b>CtpP.nc</b> respectively
  	</li>
  </p>
  	
  <pre> 	
    #ifdef CTPPROPERTY
        interface SimProperty as Property1;
        interface SimProperty as Property2;
    #endif 
  </pre>
  <pre> 	
    #ifdef CTPPROPERTY
        Property1 = Router.Property1; //"Router" is the alias of generic module "CtpRoutingEngineP.nc"
        Property2 = Router.Property2;
    #endif 
  </pre>
  
  <p>
  	<li>
  		(4)	At last, following two snippets will be inserted into the <b>provides</b> part 
  		and <b>implementation</b> part of <b>CtpRoutingEngineP.nc</b>
  	</li>
  </p>
  
  <pre> 	
    #ifdef CTPPROPERTY
        interface SimProperty as Property1;
        interface SimProperty as Property2;
    #endif
  </pre>
  
  <pre> 	
    #ifdef CTPPROPERTY
      command bool Property1.safetyPropertyCheck() {
        return TRUE;
      }
      command bool Property1.livenessPropertyCheck() {
        return TRUE;
      }
      
      command bool Property2.safetyPropertyCheck() {
        return TRUE;
      }
      command bool Property2.livenessPropertyCheck() {
        return TRUE;
      }
    #endif
  </pre>
  
  <p>
  	<li>
  		(5)	At last, since T-Check concentrates on real-code checking, 
  		users should fill <i>safetyPropertyCheck</i> and <i>livenessPropertyCheck</i> 
  		with executable code, which is written upon variables defined in corresponding modules.
  		<b>Note</b> that if the corresponding property is satisfied, then return <b>TRUE</b>; 
  		otherwise, return <b>FALSE</b>.  
  	</li>
  </p>
  
  <h4> 1.2 How to write the properties? </h4>
    <p>
    	Users may refer to <a href="propertyexamples.html" target="_blank">property examples</a> which were all expressed
      in executable manner and checked by T-Check.
    </p>
    
    <p> The property for single node application should be expressed like below: </p> 
    <pre>
      command bool SimProperty.livenessPropertyCheck() {
        return !receiveState.bufZeroLocked && !receiveState.bufOneLocked;
      }
    </pre>
    
    <p>
    	The property for multiple nodes application can be written via following two modes: 
    </p>
    <p>(1). Sample liveness property for multi-nodes CTP with all motes' number starting from 0 and <b>continuous</b>  
    </p>
    <pre>
    	command bool SimProperty.livenessPropertyCheck() {
        int tmpMote = sim_node(), mote;
        for (mote = 0; mote < sim_simulated_mote_num(); mote++) {
           sim_set_node (mote);   //change to mote¡¯s context
           if (sim_mote_forms_loop (mote)) {
             sim_set_node (tmpMote);
             return FALSE;
           }
        }
        sim_set_node (tmpMote);
        return TRUE;
      }
    </pre>

    <p>(2). Sample liveness property for multi-nodes CTP with all mote's number starting from 0 but <b>non-continuous</b>
    </p>
    <pre>
    	command bool SimProperty.livenessPropertyCheck() {
        int tmpMote = sim_node(), mote;
        for (mote = 0; mote < sim_max_mote_num(); mote++) {
          if(sim_mote_status(mote) == ON) {
            sim_set_node (mote);  //change to mote¡¯s context
            if(sim_mote_forms_loop (mote)) {
               sim_set_node (tmpMote);
               return FALSE;
            }
          }
        }
        sim_set_node (tmpMote);
        return TRUE;
      }
    </pre>
    
    <p>The main difference between above two modes concentrates on whether the mote's number is continuous or not. 
    	<b>Note that</b> sim_set_node(mote) function is critical for changing current context to specific mote's context.
    </p>
